/********************************************************************
A Function to Update the "Updated On" Field for Table Columns

By default, PostgreSQL does not support the create table syntax with
the statement:

.. code-block:: sql

    updated_on TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

However, the same can be implemented by using a function and a trigger
which is equivalent to the internal functionality of other databases
flavors like MySQL.

The function is defined under the "public" schema, as this trigger may
be accessed by all the tables that may belong to a different schema.
Ensure the field is always named as `updated_on` in all the tables;
otherwise, a separate function needs to be created. The trigger function
is table-specific and should be created for each table.

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TRIGGER <trigger-name> BEFORE UPDATE
    ON <table-name> FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE onupdate();

The function is defined such that the "updated_on" field is updated
whenever the row is updated, for any underlying table with a trigger.
