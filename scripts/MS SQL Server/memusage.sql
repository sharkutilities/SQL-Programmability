/********************************************************************
A Query for MS-SQL Server to Get Memory Usage Details

The special system table `sys.tables` provides detailed informations
like when the table was created and memory usaages. The following
simple query can be used to fetch data and is ordered based on total
memory used in descending order.

NOTE: This query is not allowed in some version of the MS-SQL server,
for more information check MS-SQL documentation for more information.
